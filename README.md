# ✦ The Séance — An Adventure in Thousand Token Wood

> *Name something that doesn't exist. Three entities will channel its form.*

**HuggingFace BuildSmall Hackathon · Thousand Token Wood theme**

---

## What It Is

You type a concept that should not exist — *"the last color light ever made"*, *"the sound a shadow makes"*, *"the weight of a forgotten name"* — and three distinct AI entities channel it back to you simultaneously.

The outputs compose a single artifact card: two text panels and one AI-generated image. Every summoning is unique and unrepeatable.

---

## The Three Entities

| Entity | Personality | Model | Params |
|--------|------------|-------|--------|
| **The Scientist** | Cold, precise, field-note voice | `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-4B-BF16` | 4B |
| **The Mythologist** | Ancient, folkloric, feeling-forward | `openbmb/MiniCPM3-4B` | 4B |
| **The Dreamer** | Generates the visual form of the concept | `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell` | ~12B |

**Total: ~20B params. All HuggingFace-native. All within hackathon constraints.**

The FLUX image prompt is **chained from the text outputs** — not written independently. The image is a visual synthesis of both voices.

## Example Summoning

**Concept:** *"the sound a shadow makes"*

**The Scientist:**
> Frequency: 0hz. Waveform: flat. Detectable only at perception threshold when ambient noise reaches absolute zero. Duration: indefinite.

**The Mythologist:**
> A crow that remembers every silence knew this sound. It was the noise between heartbeats before hearts existed. The deep caves still hold an echo of it.

**The Dreamer:** *(generated image: a crow dissolving into flat waveform silence, dark watercolor, cinematic)*

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zanesmit29/the-seance
cd the-seance
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run in mock mode — no API keys needed
MOCK_MODE=true python app.py
```

```bash
# Run with live models
cp .env.example .env
# Add your HF_TOKEN to .env
MOCK_MODE=false python app.py
```

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/
```
